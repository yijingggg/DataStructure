My name is Ooi Yi Jing with matrix number, 22004875. I am 
majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This is my first time taking the 
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling grateful about taking this 
subject. This is because this will make me one step nearer to my dream. 
I acquired A for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I 
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order 
to do well in the subject, I will definitely put more effort. Wish me luck!!!
